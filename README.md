# practice-cpp
Collection of my small practice codes and assignments for Computer Science coursework (C++, problem-solving, snippets, and exercises).

This repository contains my small practice codes and assignments for Computer Science classes at BHCC.  
It includes short problem-solving programs, weekly assignments, and reusable code snippets.

## Practices
- **celsius_to_fahrenheit.cpp** â†’ Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit.

## Notes
- Each file is a self-contained program.
- Larger, polished projects are available in my main repo: [isa-projects](https://github.com/IsaMoscatel/isa-projects).
