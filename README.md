# practice-cpp
Collection of my small practice codes and assignments for Computer Science coursework (C++, problem-solving, snippets, and exercises).

This repository contains my small practice codes and assignments for Computer Science classes at BHCC.  
It includes short problem-solving programs, weekly assignments, and reusable code snippets.

## Practices
- **celsius_to_fahrenheit.cpp** → Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit.
- **odd_or_even.cpp** → Check if a number is odd or even.
- **grade_calculator.cpp** → Simple grading program using conditionals.
- **multiplication_table.cpp** → Print a multiplication table for a number.
- **factorial.cpp** → Calculate factorial using a loop.

## Notes
- Each file is a self-contained program.
- Larger, polished projects are available in my main repo: [isa-projects](https://github.com/IsaMoscatel/isa-projects).
